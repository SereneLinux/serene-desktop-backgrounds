When you build this package in fedora core, make sure you also build a
copy for RHEL, since there are a RHEL-specific things that gets added
when you do that. If you forget this, the new version will not be used
in RHEL.

If you build e.g. desktop-backgrounds-2.0-26 in fedora, then build
desktop-backgrounds-2.0-26.1E for RHEL.
